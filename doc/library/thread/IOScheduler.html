<p>Subclass of <code><a href="Scheduler.html">Scheduler</a></code> that offers support for introduction of synchronous I/O operations integrated with the scheduler.
This class offers support to implement I/O operations that switch execution for other threads until the I/O channel is ready.
This class is useful for implementation of I/O operations integrated with the cooperative scheduling mechanism in order to maximize the processing time.</p>

<p>The instances of this class have two more lists mapping I/O channels (<i>e.g.</i> socket or file) to the suspended threads that should be resumed when the channel becomes ready for reading or writing.
Additionally, it uses a provided function (<i>e.g.</i> <code>socket.select</code> function of <a href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/luasocket">LuaSocket</a> package) to select I/O channels ready for access.</p>

<h2>Behavior</h2>

<h3>Initialization</h3>

<dl>
	
	<dt><code><b>IOScheduler</b>([object])</code></dt>
	<dd>
	Executes the same initialization of its superclass <code><a href="Scheduler.html">Scheduler</a></code> with value provided by <code>object</code> and additionally creates the lists used to map channels to blocked threads (<i>i.e.</i> <code>reading</code> and <code>writing</code>).
	</dd>
	
</dl>

<h3>Fields</h3>

<dl>
	
	<dt><code><b>select</b></code> [required]</dt>
	<dd>
		Function that implements the same API of <code>socket.select</code> function of <a href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/luasocket">LuaSocket</a> package but can select channels of any type supported by the <code>IOScheduler</code> instance.
	</dd>
	
	<dt><code><b>sleep</b></code> [required]</dt>
	<dd>
		Function that suspends the execution of the application for the ammount of seconds given as argument.
		This function called when the scheduler is idle and no thread is blocked on I/O channels.
	</dd>
	
</dl>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<dl>
	
	<dt><code><b>remove</b>(coroutine)</code></dt>
	<dd>
		Redefinition of superclass method in order to also remove the <code>coroutine</code> from the lists of I/O blocked threads.
	</dd>
	
	<dt><code><b>register</b>(coroutine)</code></dt>
	<dd>
		Redefinition of superclass method in order to check if the registering  <code>coroutine</code> is not already registered in the lists of I/O blocked threads.
	</dd>

	<dt><code><b>step</b>()</code></dt>
		Redefinition of superclass method that also unblocks waiting threads when their I/O channels are ready for access.
	<dd>
		
	</dd>
	
</dl>

<h2>Remarks</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		This class was mainly devised for use with the asynchronous support provided by <a href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/luasocket">LuaSocket</a> library for socket channels.
		Therefore, it may not cope very well with other asynchronous I/O libraries.
	</li>
	<li>
		This class is not very scalable nor efficient due to constrains imposed by <a href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/luasocket">LuaSocket</a> API.
		Mainly due to the <code>socket.select</code> function.
	</li>
</ul>
